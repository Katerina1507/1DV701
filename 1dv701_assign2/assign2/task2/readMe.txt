How to run the program. 
1. open command prompt  
2. write in command prompt javac Server.java
			               java Server 8080 public
example: 
C:\Users\Katja\Desktop\network security\14022023\task2\src>javac Server.java
C:\Users\Katja\Desktop\network security\14022023\task2\src>java Server 8080 public

3. I have used port 8080. You can use other port.
4. In the python file, please change the port, otherwise the test will be failed.
I have written there 8080 port, which I used.
5. In the folder you can find the file is called testa2u1.py
   I have done test of my code.
   I have opened command prompt and wrote python testa2u1.py
example: C:\Users\Katja\Desktop\network security\14022023\task2> python testa2u1.py

6.  In the folder public - all files.
7.  For understanding: The javac command is used to convert the Java source file into the class file.
    The java command is used to run a Java program stored in a .class file.
